This library is a dependency of the JeroenVermeulen_Solarium extension.

The best way to add an external library to a project is to include it via a Composer dependency.
However, Magento Connect's installer is not (yet) based on Composer. Everything needs to be inside the package.
That is why this library is copied to the JeroenVermeulen_Solarium extension instead of linking it.
